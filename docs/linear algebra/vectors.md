# Vectors

Vectors are often used to represent a point in some $`N`$ dimensional space. Vectors can be written in either column form or row form depending on the context. In this library vectors are not treated any differently to Matrices. A column vector is just a matrix that only has one column and a row vector is a matrix that only has one row. 

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{1} \\
a_{2} \\
\vdots \\
a_{n} 
\end{bmatrix}

OR

\begin{bmatrix}
a_{1} & a_{2} & \cdots & a_{n} 
\end{bmatrix}
```
