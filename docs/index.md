# Welcome

Qkmaxware.Numerics is a C# library for numerical analysis. Since Numerics is built off of `.Net Standard 2.1`, it is compatible with the `.Net Framework` as well as `.Net Core`.

This site serves as a resource for installing and using the Numerics Library.

## What is Numerical Analysis
Numerical analysis is the study of functions, algorithms, and data that use numerical approximations as opposed to symbolic manipulations. Typically, numerical analysis is used in the fields of engineering, physical science, and scientific computations. 

Numerical analysis methods cover a wide variety of topics including integration and derivation, differential equation solving, linear algebra, complex analysis, and statistics.
